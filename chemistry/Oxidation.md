$\ce{2Cu + O2 -> 2CuO}$

Bonding of $\ce{Cu}$: metallic
Bonding of $\ce{O2}$: covalent
Bonding of $\ce{CuO}$: ionic

$\ce{Cu}$ was oxidised, $\ce{O2}$ was reduced. 

Examples:

$\ce{Zn_{(s)} + CuSO4_{(aq)} -> Cu_{(s)} + ZnSO4_{(aq)}}$

$\ce{Zn_{(s)}}$ was oxidised
$\ce{CuSO4_{(aq)}}$ was reduced


$\ce{Cl2_{(g)} + 2Fe^{2+}_{(aq)} -> 2Cl^-_{(aq)} + 2Fe^{3+}_{(aq)}}$

$Fe^{2+}_{(aq)}$ was oxidised
$Cl2_{(g)}$ was reduced


$\ce{Cu + S -> CuS}$

$\ce{Cu}$ was oxidised
$\ce{S}$ was reduced
