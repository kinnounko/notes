# Oxidation 

Historical definitions: 

- Addition of oxygen
- Loss of hydrogen 
- Most recent: the loss of electrons 

## Reduction

The opposite of oxidation

- Loss of oxygen 
- Addition of hydrogen
- Addition of electrons

$\ce{2Cu + O2 -> 2CuO}$

Bonding of $\ce{Cu}$: metallic
Bonding of $\ce{O2}$: covalent
Bonding of $\ce{CuO}$: ionic

$\ce{Cu}$ was oxidised, $\ce{O2}$ was reduced. 

Examples:

$\ce{Zn_{(s)} + CuSO4_{(aq)} -> Cu_{(s)} + ZnSO4_{(aq)}}$

$\ce{Zn_{(s)}}$ was oxidised
$\ce{CuSO4_{(aq)}}$ was reduced


$\ce{Cl2_{(g)} + 2Fe^{2+}_{(aq)} -> 2Cl^-_{(aq)} + 2Fe^{3+}_{(aq)}}$

$Fe^{2+}_{(aq)}$ was oxidised
$Cl2_{(g)}$ was reduced


$\ce{Cu + S -> CuS}$

$\ce{Cu}$ was oxidised
$\ce{S}$ was reduced


## Rules for assigning oxidation states 

1. The oxidation state of an element is always zero 
2. In an unchanged compound, the sum of all oxidation states is always zero
3. Treat the compounds as totally ionic. If it is ionic then the charges on the ions are the oxidation numbers, e.g. in $\ce{KCl}$ O.S. of $\ce{K}$ is +1 and the O.S. of $\ce{Cl}$ is -1
4. The most electronegative atom in an element is addigned a negative oxidation number according to how many electrons it needs to gain a full outer shell, 
5. The maximum possible oxidation number of ... (in book)

* For ions containing more than one element, the sum of all the oxidation states is equal to the charge on the ion 
* In compounds and ions, some elements have oxidation states that rarely change:
* $\ce{F}$: -1 (always)
* $\ce{O}$: -2 (except in $\ce{O2}$, $\ce{OF2}$, $\ce{O2F2}$, and some metal oxides)
* $\ce{H}$: +1 (except when combined with metals as $\ce{H}$)
* $\ce{Cl}$: -1 (except when combined with $\ce{O}$ and $\ce{F}$)
* Group 1 metals: +1
* Group 2 metals: +2

### Questions: 

$\ce{BaBr2}$ --- $\ce{Ba^{+2}Br^{-1}2}$

$\ce{CuF}$ --- $\ce{Cu^{+1}F^{-1}}$

$\ce{NH3}$ --- $\ce{N^{-3}H^{+1}}$

$\ce{PH3}$ --- $\ce{P^{-3}H^{+1}}$

$\ce{NH4Cl}$ --- $\ce{N^{-3}H^{}4Cl}$

### Assign oxidation states to: 

1. $\ce{SO4^{2-}}$ --- $\ce{S^{+6}O^{-2}4^{ 2-}}$
2. $\ce{Cr2O7^{2-}}$ --- $\ce{Cr2^{+6}O7^{2-}}$

### Identifying redox reactions 

* A reaction is redox if it involves a change in oxidation state of any element taking part 

Are the following redox reactions? 

* $\ce{Fe_{(s)} + S_{(s)} -> FeS_{(s)}}$ : Redox, oxidation state change from 0 to +2
* $\ce{NaOH_{(aq)} + HCl_{(aq)} -> NaCl_{(aq)} + H20_{(l)}}$: Not redox because oxidation states don't change
* $\ce{CuO_{(s)} + H2_{(g)} -> Cu_{(s)} + H2O_{(g)}}$ : Redox 
* $\ce{MnO2_{(s)} + 4HCl_{(aq)} -> MnCl2_{(aq)} + Cl2_{(g)} + 2H2O_{(l)}}$ : Redox, change in oxidation states
* $\ce{2H2O2_{(aq)} -> 2H2O_{(l)} + O2_{(g)}}$ : Redox, some oxidation states have changed
