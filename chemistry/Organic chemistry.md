# Organic chemistry

Study of compounds that involve carbon, specifically those with a $\ce{C-H}$ bond.

Organic chemistry is a major branch of chemistry. What is so special about carbon? 
* 4 strong covalent bonds
* carbon is the "sweet spot" of periodicity in that it reacts with other atoms/molecules easily

## Alkanes 

The alkanes are a family of hydrocarbons (compound containing only carbon and hydrogen)

You need to know to draw the molecular formula, empirical and structural formula for:
Methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane.

Methane: 
```smiles
C
```

Ethane:
```smiles
CC
```

Propane:
```smiles
CCC
```

Butane:
```smiles
CCCC
```

Pentane:
```smiles
CCCCC
```

Hexane:
```smiles
CCCCCC
```

### Homologous series

* The Alkanes represent a homologous series. 

* A series of compounds that have the same functional group (similar chemicals basically)

* In general, London forces get stronger as the relative molecular mass increases: 
    * This is because there is a larger electron density, and as such, a higher probability of the compound being arranged asymmetrically

### Structural isomerism 

* Alkanes with four or more carbon can show different arrangements of the carbon atoms.

* See how many different structures you can make with the molecular formula $\ce{C_6H_14}$, hexane.

### Naming compounds

* Identify the longest chain of the carbon atoms. This gives the stem of the name. 

* Identify the functional group. This determines the suffix of the name. The alkanes don't have a functional group but their suffix is <i>-ane</i>

* Identify side chains. The side chains encountered so far are called alkyl groups. The side chain is given as the prefix of the name. 

Hexane's structural isomers: 

$\text{2-methylpentane}$
```smiles
CCCC(C)C
```

$\text{3-methylpentane}$
```smiles
CCC(C)CC
```

$\text{2,3-dimethylbutane}$
```smiles
CC(C)C(C)C
```

$\text{2,2-dimethylbutane}$
```smiles
CCC(C)(C)C
```

Name this compound:

```smiles
C C C(C) C(C)(C) C C
```

$\color{red}\text{3,3,4-trimethylhexane}$

Name this compound 

```smiles
C C C C(CC)(C) C C 
```

$\color{red}\text{3-Ethyl-3-methylhexane}$

## Saturated and unsaturated carbon atoms

Alcohols (R-OH) contain a hydroxyl group (OH)

```smiles
CCO
```

It is a part of the functional group of *hydroxyls*

## Naming alcohols


Alocohols are names alkan-$x$-ol

| Name        | Molecular formula | 
| ----------- | ----------------- | 
| methanol    | $\ce{CH2OH}$      |      
| ethanol     | $\ce{C2H6O}$      |   
| propan-1-ol | $\ce{C3H8O}$      |   

When $x$ is not 1 in the alcohol, the numbering is chosen to give a lower number to the OH group than to an alkyl group. 

For example: 
$\text{5-methylhexan-3-ol}$

Name this compound:
```smiles
CCC(C(C)C)O
```

$\red{\text{2-methylpentan-3-ol}}$

## Naming unsaturated hydrocarbons

```smiles
CCC(=C)C
```

$\red{\text{2-methylbut-1-ene}}$

## Combustion of hydrocarbons

Draw a balanced equation for the combustion of ethane. 

$\ce{2C2H6 + 7O2 ->[{heat}] 4H2O + 6CO2 }$

## Incomplete combustion 

Incomplete combustion produces carbon monoxide and soot (C)

$\ce{2C2H6 + 5O2 ->[{heat}] 4CO + 6H2O }$

$\ce{2C2H6 + 3O2 ->[{heat}] 4C + 6H2O }$


## Exothermic and Endothermic reactions

In an exothermic reaction, heat is released
In an endothermic reaction, heat is taken from the surroundings

## Enthalpy

Enthalpy, H is the term used for the amount of heat energy contained in a substance

## Questions

The H-Cl bond enthalpy is 431 kJ mol-1. Write an equation to represent this: 

HCl (g) -> H (g) + Cl (g) $\delta H = +431 kJ mol^{-1}$
