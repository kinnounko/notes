# Organic chemistry

Study of compounds that involve carbon, specifically those with a $\ce{C-H}$ bond.

Organic chemistry is a major branch of chemistry. What is so special about carbon? 
* 4 strong covalent bonds
* carbon is the "sweet spot" of periodicity in that it reacts with other atoms/molecules easily

## Alkanes 

The alkanes are a family of hydrocarbons (compound containing only carbon and hydrogen)

You need to know to draw the molecular formula, empirical and structural formula for:
Methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, hexane.

Methane:

Ethane:

Propane:

Butane:
```smiles

```

Pentane:
```smiles

```

Hexane:
```smiles
CCCCCC
```

### Homologous series

* The Alkanes represent a homologous series. 

* A series of compounds that have the same functional group (similar chemicals basically)

* In general, London forces get stronger as the relative molecular mass increases: 
    * This is because there is a larger electron density, and as such, a higher probability of the compound being arranged asymmetrically

### Structural isomerism 

* Alkanes with four or more carbon can show different arrangements of the carbon atoms.

* See how many different structures you can make with the molecular formula $\ce{C_6H_14}$, hexane.

### Naming compounds

* Identify the longest chain of the carbon atoms. This gives the stem of the name. 

* Identify the functional group. This determines the suffix of the name. The alkanes don't have a functional group but their suffix is <i>-ane</i>

* Identify side chains. The side chains encountered so far are called alkyl groups. The side chain is given as the prefix of the name. 

Hexane's structural isomers: 

$\text{2-methylpentane}$
```smiles
CCCC(C)C
```

$\text{3-methylpentane}$
```smiles
CCC(C)CC
```

$\text{2,3-dimethylbutane}$
```smiles
CC(C)C(C)C
```

$\text{2,2-dimethylbutane}$
```smiles
CCC(C)(C)C
```
