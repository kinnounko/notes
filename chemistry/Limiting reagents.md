# Limiting reagents

## Lab about limiting reagents

$\ce{ZnO}$ (zinc oxide):  
  $6.01g$ before 
  $4.10g$ after
1. Mass of $\ce{ZnO}$ used:
  $$6.11 g - 4.10 g = 2.01 g$$
2. Molar mass of $\ce{ZnO}$:
  $$65.38 g/mol + 15.99 g/mol = 81.38 g/mol$$
3. How many moles of zinc reacted with the $\ce{HCl}$?
  $$2.01 g \div 81.38 g/mol = 0.0246 mol$$
4. Balance the equation for this experiment
  $$\ce{ZnO(aq) + 2 HCl(aq) -> ZnCl2(aq) + H2O(l)}$$
5. Find the number of moles of $\ce{HCl}$ in 
  $$\ce{HCl} = 1.01g/mol + 35.45g/mol = 36.46g/mol$$
  $$\ce{HCl} = 20 \div 36.46g/mol = 0.549 mol$$
6. Find the number of moles of $\ce{HCl}$ in 
  $$\ce{HCl} = 0.549 mol * 50 = 27.45 mol$$
