\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}

Naturally occurring disasters such as tsunamis are devastating for 
people and resources residing in risk areas. These tsunamis are caused 
by many different types of natural phenomena such as landslides, collapse of 
seamount, or more rarely, the impact of a meteorite. This paper however will focus 
on one of the more common cases of tsunami; one caused by the earthquakes. This 
is due to earthquakes causing around 72\% of earthquakes \cite{pacifictsunamimuseum}, and as the time between an 
earthquake event and its tsunami is relatively high compared to events such as landslides \cite{sue_nokes_walters}, 
leaving adequate time for prediction and correct preparation of the events properties, such as 
the wave height, as discussed in this paper. 

\subsection{Personal Engagement}

I have chosen to write about this subject as I have recently become interested by the 
statistics and its implications in real-life matters. This research has proved very 
interesting for me as it has abstracted the field of statistics for me. Furthermore, 
as I enjoy programming, the research I have done has helped me learn about the tools 
and technologies used by data analysts and other professionals of the matter.

\section{Statistical Model}

\subsection{Cleaning the dataset}

The dataset, \cite{noaa}

\subsection{Regression}


\subsection{Ease of access of data}
For an easy access to the predictions generated by the program, I implemented 
a simple function to fetch new earthquake events from the \url{https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php} 
live earthquake feed. These earthquake events are quantified into a magnitude \verb|mag| 
and a distance \verb|dist| variable, which are supplied to the statistical model. 
This information is then easily accessible from a human-readable report exported 
to a plaintext file. 

\section{Uses of this research}

The research included in this paper could be useful for many life-saving scenarios, 
notably ones in which, for example, high quality and large-scale tsunami alert 
systems are not available. 

\section{Conclusion}

\subsection{Evaluation of the method used}

This method, like any other statistical approximation, is by no means perfect 
and for that reason should not be used in any real-world application. The results 
procured by the program
