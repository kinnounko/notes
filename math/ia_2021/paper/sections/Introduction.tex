\section{Introduction}

Naturally occurring disasters such as tsunamis are devastating for 
people and resources residing in risk areas. These tsunamis are caused 
by many different types of natural phenomena such as landslides, collapse of 
seamount, or more rarely, the impact of a meteorite. This paper however will focus 
on one of the more common cases of tsunami; one caused by the earthquakes. This 
is due to earthquakes causing around 72\% of earthquakes. \cite{pacifictsunamimuseum}
