## Developing a point of view

1. Young people: from a negative point of view

Nowadays, young people spend all their time doing useless tasks and spreading false information. Youngsters who use social media are fed tonnes of questionable and useless information that could easily be replaced with academics and studying. They waste every second of their lives on the Internet playing games or spreading the aforementioned false information.. Truly deplorable...

## Playing with point of view

1. Arguing for: "I never want to be famous, for any reason":

I would never want to be famous. The responsibilities would be too weighing, and constantly being in the limelight would only incite pressure in me. Imagine having a board of people watching your every move - or a crowd of paparazzis incessantly taking pictures of you. Privacy would become obsolete for you and never could you go back to your former peaceful life. 



| Examiner tip: IGCSE examiners say the "impassioned battle cry" is often what lifts excellent work off the page. It doesn't have to be your voice! Think about different positions, make choices, consider the following: what is the best position to give "the impassioned battle cry" from?Â |  
| :------------- | 


2. Arguing for an opposite point of view: "I would want to be the lead scientist in the team that foudn the covid-19 vaccine"

Imagine being regarded as someone who saved the world, brought an end to one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. The amount of praise, awards and commendations you would receive would be a great prize for the amount of work you had just completed for the good of humanity. Your name would go down in history and people all around the world would commend you.


## Borrowing tone

Children nowadays, seem to be quite set on what they want to be when they're older. These goals can however, seem pretty unrealistic. With large influences such as Billie Eilish or Lionel Messi, young people seem to have set their sights on what they want to be when they're older. Some parents, worried about their childrens ambitious dreams,still seem favor the traditional professions for their children.
