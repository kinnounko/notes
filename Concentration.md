# Concentration

concentration ($mol \cdot dm^{-3}$) = number of moles ($mol$) / volume ($dm^3$)
or
$c = m / V$

moles of hydrochloric acid, HCl (aq) in 50.0 cm^3 of 2.00 mol dm^⁻3 hydrochloric acid

0.4 mol/L

## Dilution of solutions 

A common practice is to make a dilution from a "stock solution", by adding solvent. 

$c_{1} V_{1} = c_{2} V_{2}$


## Lab about solutions 

$$\ce{CH3COOH + NaOH -> CH3COONa + H2O}$$

Mole ratio: 1 : 1 : 1 : 1

Moles of $\ce{CH3COOH}$: $0.1 mol \cdot 25 \times 10^{-3} = 0.0025 mol$

|                | $\ce{CH3COOH}$ | $\ce{NaOH}$  |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
|  volume ($dm^3$) | More Stuff   | And Again    |
| ($mol \cdot dm^-3$)   | Put Pipes In | Like this \| |
| n ($mol$)   | Put Pipes In | Like this \| |

### Titration 
- A technique used for determining volumes of solutions that react together
- A known volume of one solution is put into the concial flask
- The other solution is put into a burette
- The solution in the burette is slowly added unil the reaction has finished
