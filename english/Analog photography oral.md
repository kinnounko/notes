Photography is an aspect of everyone's daily lives, whether we acknowledge it or not. People take 1.3 trillion pictures in the year 2017, and this number is constantly rising. 

Of course, this statistic has changed drastically from previous times. Nowadays, these pictures are mostly taken with mobile phones, as they offer a high level of convenience. 

Before our current high-tech world of instant pictures, there were months of development of expensive rolls of film. Film set the standard after it was invented in 1885, and became commonplace in every photographers materials. The film camera itself developed new features such as more advanced features, until the 21<sup>st</sup> century. 

Companies stopped production of film cameras and film and declared the process a "dying art", as the sales of a new and faster digital format skyrocketed. However as with everything, a small enthusiast community lived on. 

With the rise of social media during the 2010s, many people became aware of the now outdated film process. For example, Instagram offered many filters made to resemble the look of film. 

A new generation of Internet users learned techniques from the examples presented by older users of film photography. A sort of revival of film photography has occurred in the past decade.

Companies like Kodak have decided to, as such, reinstate production of film. Camera manufacturers have also restarted production of old and updated versions of their cameras. Vintage cameras are sold on websites like eBay for staggering prices, as there is now a demand for them.
