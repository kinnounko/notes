### Analog Photography

#### Presentation

* After being invented in 1885, film became the standard for the next century (and a bit more) to come
* Black and white film was the first to appear
* Then came an experimental color film, perfected by Kodak to become the color film today
* The film camera itself had also slowly evolved with newer and more advanced technologies (e.g. for light metering) 
* The film photography process was thought to be dead as the digital format became the norm in the beginning of the 21st century... Kodak stopping production of traditional film cameras in 2004 and Nikon in 2006, Japan Times declaring Film Photography a "dying art"
* Interest from a new generation has however revived the art, Kodak and Fujifilm have started manufacturing a larger quantity of film... Social media has played a large role in this revive. 
* Digital cameras are expensive to buy as opposed to analog cameras however film and the development process are expensive and complicated.
