\section{Further research opportunities}

\subsection{Investigating newer, more efficient algorithms}

As the computation of $\pi$ moved from paper to machines, as all did from accounting to
mathematics, newer and more efficient methods were developed, notably by Ramanujan and
the Chudnovsky brothers.
